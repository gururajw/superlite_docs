Citing SuperLite
================

If you use SuperLite for any publications or presentations, please appropriately acknowledge SuperLite and cite the [SuperLite paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acda23) in which the methods are described, and also cite the corresponding Zenodo repository (10.5281/zenodo.8102236).

For example:
This work made use of a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SuperLite (Wagle et al. 2023, Wagle 2023)

BibTeX entry for the SuperLite methods paper
```
@article{Wagle_et_al_2023,
	author = {{Wagle}, Gururaj A. and {Chatzopoulos}, Emmanouil and {Wollaeger}, Ryan T. and {Fontes}, Christopher J.},
	journal = {\apj},
	month = aug,
	number = {2},
	pages = {132},
	title = {{Monte Carlo Radiation Transport for Astrophysical Transients Powered by Circumstellar Interaction}},
	volume = {953},
	year = 2023}
```

To cite the SuperLite Zenodo repository, you can create a BibTeX entry similar to following example:
```
@misc{gururaj_wagle_2023_8111119 ,
    author       = {Gururaj Wagle},
    title        = {{SuperLite: IMC-DDMC Radiation Transport Code for Interacting Transients}},<br>
    month        = jul,
    year         = 2023,
    doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.8111119 },
    version      = {r1.0.0},
    publisher    = {Zenodo},
    url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8111119 }
    }
```
