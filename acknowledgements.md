================

SuperLite was developed with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant AST-1907617.
Iâ€™d also like to thank Ryan Wollaeger for his exceptional support in the development of the SuperLite 
code, particularly for his invaluable assistance in debugging the issue related to Doppler shift 
corrections in high-velocity gradient regions.
